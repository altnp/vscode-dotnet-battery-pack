# .NET Battery Pack VS Code Extension

.NET Battery Pack closes gaps between popular .NET extensions, upgrading your Resharper, C# Dev Kit, and DotRush experience for Visual Studio Code. It brings advanced semantic snippets, surround-with refactorings, and NuGet package management to your workflow.

## Features

- **Semantic Snippets for C#**

  - Context-aware code completions for C# files powered by the DotRush Language Server

  - Only shows snippet completions, filtering out other types

  - Automatically disables built-in C# snippets to avoid duplication

  - > **Warning** > **Requires DotRush extension to be installed, but not enabled.**
    > DotRush Language Server provides the semantic snippets, but the extension itself must remain disabled to avoid conflicts with C# Dev Kit and other extensions.

  - **Enabled by default only when C# Dev Kit is active and DotRush is installed but disabled**

- **Surround With Refactorings**

  - Adds "Surround With" code actions for C# (right-click or lightbulb menu)

  - Supports: if, if/else, for, for reverse, foreach, try/catch, try/finally, try/catch/finally, while, using, lock

  - "More..." menu for additional surround options

  - Works on selected code or current line

  - **Enabled only when C# Dev Kit is not enabled**

- **NuGet Package Commands**

  - Add, update, or remove NuGet packages from projects or solutions

  - Search for packages (optionally include prerelease)

  - Select version to install or update

  - Multi-project/solution support

  - Toggle inclusion of prerelease packages

  - **Enabled by default for all .NET projects**
